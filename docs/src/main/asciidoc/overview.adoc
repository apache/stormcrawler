== Overview
:imagesdir: images

link:https://storm.apache.org/[Apache Storm]Crawler is an open source collection of resources for building low-latency, scalable web crawlers on link:http://storm.apache.org/[Apache Storm]. It is provided under the link:http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0[Apache License] and is written mostly in Java.

The aims of StormCrawler are to help build web crawlers that are:

* Scalable
* Low latency
* Easy to extend
* Polite yet efficient

StormCrawler is both a library and a collection of reusable components designed to help developers build custom web crawlers with ease.
Getting started is simple — the Maven archetypes allow you to quickly scaffold a new project, which you can then adapt to fit your specific needs.

In addition to its core modules, StormCrawler offers a range of external resources that can be easily integrated into your project.
These include spouts and bolts for OpenSearch, as well as a ParserBolt that leverages Apache Tika to handle various document formats and many more.

StormCrawler is well-suited for scenarios where URLs to fetch and parse arrive as continuous streams, but it also performs exceptionally in large-scale, recursive crawls where low latency is essential.
The project is actively maintained, widely adopted in production environments, and supported by an engaged community.

You can find links to recent talks and demos later in this document, showcasing real-world applications and use cases.

== Key Features

Here is a short list of provided features:

* Integration with link:https://github.com/crawler-commons/url-frontier[URLFrontier] for distributed URL management
* Pluggable components (Spouts and Bolts from link:https://storm.apache.org/[Apache Storm]) for flexibility and modularity — adding custom components is straightforward
* Support for link:https://tika.apache.org/[Apache Tika] for document parsing via `ParserBolt`
* Integration with link:https://opensearch.org/[OpenSearch] and link:https://solr.apache.org/[Apache Solr] for indexing and status storage
* Option to store crawled data as WARC (Web ARChive) files
* Support for headless crawling using link:https://playwright.dev/[Playwright]
* Support for LLM-based advanced text extraction
* Proxy support for distributed and controlled crawling
* Flexible and pluggable filtering mechanisms:
** URL Filters for pre-fetch filtering
** Parse Filters for post-fetch content filtering
* Built-in support for crawl metrics and monitoring
* Configurable politeness policies (e.g., crawl delay, user agent management)
* Robust HTTP fetcher based on link:https://hc.apache.org/[Apache HttpComponents] or link:https://square.github.io/okhttp/[OkHttp].
* MIME type detection and response-based filtering
* Support for parsing and honoring `robots.txt` and sitemaps
* Stream-based, real-time architecture using link:https://storm.apache.org/[Apache Storm] — suitable for both recursive and one-shot crawling tasks
* Can run in both local and distributed environments
* Apache Maven archetypes for quickly bootstrapping new crawler projects
* Actively developed and used in production by link:powered-by.adoc[multiple organizations]
